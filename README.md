## üìå Problem Statement Chosen  
**"Autonomous Web Navigator AI Agent"** ‚Äì Build an AI Agent that can take natural language instructions and autonomously drive the web on a local computer.  

---

## üí° Detailed Proposal & Prototype Plan  
The goal is to design a **local-first AI Web Agent** that eliminates the need for complex scripts and cloud-based dependencies while automating web browsing tasks through natural language.  

**Prototype Workflow:**  
1. **Input Layer:** User gives instructions in plain text or voice.  
2. **Processing Layer:** Local LLM parses the instruction into step-by-step tasks.  
3. **Execution Layer:** Browser automation tool (Puppeteer/Playwright/Selenium) executes actions.  
4. **Output Layer:** Clean structured outputs (tables, JSON, CSV) are generated and displayed in CLI/GUI.  

**Prototype Deliverables:**  
- Lightweight GUI for input/output.  
- Ability to perform at least 3 types of tasks: **Search & Extract**, **Form Filling**, and **Comparison Tables**.  
- Local execution ensuring security and privacy.
